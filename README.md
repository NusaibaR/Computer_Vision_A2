# Computer_Vision_A3
The projects includes the folowing 3 files:

1- Image Segmentation using K-means & EM:
   The k-means and EM algorithms are implmented from scratch using numpy library. 
   
2- Stereo Vision with Epipolar Geometry:
   Implmented using OpenCV library.
   The stereo image-pair are obtained from the Middlebury dataset: http:vision.middlebury.edu/stereo/data/scenes2014/ .
   
3- Motion Algorithm with Multi-resolution Lucas-Kanade optical flow estimation:
   Implmented using OpenCV library.
